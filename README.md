# Unity3D-ZombieFPS_Game

https://gamejolt.com/games/emptyvessel/481391

This game is a first-person zombie shooter that implements advanced gun mechanics such as gun animations, player leaning, weapon sway, and bullet spread. I constructed a patrol path and zombie wander system to make my artificial intelligence more advanced and dynamic. My AI responds to volumetric and collision triggers, and work under a finite state machine. The game takes place in a massive abandoned city and its outskirts with a lot of room for exploration. To further the verisimilitude, I incorporated post-processing effects, which amplify the overall look of the game.

The town you once knew is no more. It has been 5 years since you died.

For an unknown reason, you come back to life without being infected.

As you search for answers, you are faced with danger at every corner.

For now, you have one goal.

Escape.
